Hi my name is Shan. I'm currently a  data ~~analyst~~ scientist based in London, with a background in mathematics and some programming I did in school. 

I discovered data science over 2 years ago and realised it was my dream job. So I talked it over with my wife and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.

I didn't post much or accomplish as many tasks as I would have liked in 2017 or 2018 but hopefully I can change that. I hope to post more in the future.

At the moment here are things I would like to finish in 2018

- Post at least ~~10~~ 6 times this year
- Finish the Data Science specilisation on Coursera. Currently I've done 4 out of 9.
- Udemy course Workshop in Probability & Statics **(68% done)**. My statistics wasn't great so decided to brush up as this is a key part of data science
- ~~Become proficient in Python & R~~
- Finish reading Hadley Wickham's R for Data Science book [available online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
